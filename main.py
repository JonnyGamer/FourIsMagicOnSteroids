# This Python Program finds solutions for A058230

# These are chached values for word lengths of million, billion, trillion, quadrillion.
# Or [7, 7, 8, 11, 11, ...]
# You may notice that this array is actually 2 less than these values, starting at index = 1.
# I will refer to these values in the `def illion(n)` function
