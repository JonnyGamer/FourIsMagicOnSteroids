Four is magic, but on steroids

## What is the game commonly called `Four is magic`?

Four is magic is a number algorithm.  
How does it work?  
Why is four so magical?  
You will see.

Let's take this number: 1  
1 = one, one has 3 letters.  
3 = three, three has 5 letters.  
5 = five, five has 4 letters.  
4 = four, four has 4 letters.  

Now you can see why 4 is so magical.

Let's try another:  
666 = six hundred sixty-six, has 3 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 18 letters.  
18 = eighteen, has 8 letters  
etc.

**Tricky Rules**  
1. Notice that we don't count spaces or hyphens as letters.  
2. Notice that we never say 'one hundred **and** one'

It has been proven that every number will always trace back to 4.

## Great. So, why Four is magic, but on steroids?
Ok, notice how we are always adding:  
666 = six hundred sixty-six, has 3 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 18 letters.

Instead of adding the word lengths, let's multiply them!

24 = twenty four = 6\*4 = 24

Wait. 24 -> 24!? Wow!

So when we multiply the word lengths together, numbers don't always have to trace back to 4.

## The Question:
Are there any other numbers that end somewhere else?

We are looking for every number of type:
`a -> a`  
or
`a -> b -> c -> ... -> a`

Which numbers, when we start with `a` will also end in `a`?
