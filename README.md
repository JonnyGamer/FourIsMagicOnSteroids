### What am I to do with these numbers?
I found an entry from [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/) aka OEIS  
Adding my 3 newly discovered terms to [A058230](https://oeis.org/draft/A058230)
The sequence is described as
> Numbers k such that the product of the lengths of the words in the name of k in American English is equal to k.
