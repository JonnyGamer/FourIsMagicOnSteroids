### MAJOR SPOILER IN LINK: What am I to do with these numbers?
I found an entry from [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/) aka OEIS  
The sequence is [A058230](https://oeis.org/draft/A058230)  
The sequence is described as
> Numbers k such that the product of the lengths of the words in the name of k in American English is equal to k.

Unfortunately, this sequence only keeps track of numbers of type `a -> a`.
However, I am adding my 3 newly discovered terms to it.

### Small Spoiler: How many solutions have I found?

I have found 9 solutions of type `a -> a`. A tenth solution is bigger than `10^138`


---
### Small Spoiler: Proofs

Adding proofs like, solutions of type `a -> a` will never be odd.
