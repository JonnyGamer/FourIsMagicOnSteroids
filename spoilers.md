### MAJOR SPOILER IN LINK: What am I to do with these numbers?
I found an entry from [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/) aka OEIS  
The sequence is [A058230](https://oeis.org/draft/A058230)  
The sequence is described as
> Numbers k such that the product of the lengths of the words in the name of k in American English is equal to k.

Unfortunately, this sequence only keeps track of numbers of type `a -> a`.
However, I am adding my 3 newly discovered terms to it.

### Small Spoiler: How many solutions have I found?

I have found 9 solutions of type `a -> a`.  
A tenth solution will be greater than `10^138`, if it exists.
	
Solutions for `a -> a`  
  4, 24, 84672, 1852200, 829785600, 20910597120, 92215733299200, 1239789303244800000, 887165996513213819259682435576627200000000
  
I have found 25 solutions of type `a -> b -> c -> ... -> a`  
I have only discovered 6 distinct loops.
The numbers below are the smallest such numbers.  
A 26th solution (or 7th loop) would be greater than `10^21`, if it exists

Solutions for `a -> b -> c -> ... -> a`  
 168, 175, 420, 441, 525, 588, 672, 840, 10584, 16128, 35280, 24192, 72576, 98784, 201600, 10668672, 22226400, 38896200, 1170993438720, 5576159232000, 85384938240000, 204923851776000, 1874561426506137600000, 2624385997108592640000, 22494737118073651200000

### Small Spoiler: Proofs

Adding proofs like, solutions of type `a -> a` will never be odd.
Coming soon.
